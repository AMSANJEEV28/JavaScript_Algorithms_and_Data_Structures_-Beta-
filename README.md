# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project repository! This repository contains the projects and solutions I have completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification course.

## Course Overview

The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification is designed to teach fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

- JavaScript basics (variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming
- Algorithmic thinking
- Working with local storage
- Fetching data from APIs

## Projects

This repository includes the following projects:

1. **Palindrome Checker**: Build an application that checks if a given word is a palindrome.
2. **Roman Numeral Converter**: Create an application that converts integers to Roman numerals.
3. **Telephone Number Validator**: Develop an application that validates if a number is a valid United States phone number.
4. **Cash Register**: Construct a cash register web app to calculate change.
5. **Pokémon Search App**: Build an app to search for Pokémon and display their details.
